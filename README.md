# React Student Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivations

Although the bootstrapping is generally great, React prides itself on 'un-opinionated.' However, as a student, you probably do need a bit more 'guidance' to make your initial learning curve a bit smoother.

That's why I created this template repo. It stips away testing, although this is not wholly necessary. It _does_ include some better linting and also checks for some specific common 'sloppiness.'

Prettier is also included, and I've updated `"browserslist"` to allow us to write our code for modern browsers only - no IE11, etc.

Finally, some choice extensions and settings are also included for VS Code, along with a setting to make sure that Windows users use appropriate line endings.

Anyway, all of this should limit 'student sloppiness' while also

**Run `yarn`. _Do not_ use `npm` as it can lead to some unnecessary conflicts from `yarn` and `npm`.**

## Other Available Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
